This project demonstrates the N-Queens problem, a backtracking algorithm where N queens must be placed on an N×N chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.
The algorithm uses recursion and backtracking to explore all possible placements of queens, pruning unsafe positions.
The visualization shows the chessboard and allows cycling through all valid solutions using a “Next Solution” button.
